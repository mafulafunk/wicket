This section is addressed to developers, who have already made their first experiences with Apache Wicket. Developers who get into Wicket often have difficulties with it because they apply the typical JSF and Struts patterns and approaches. These frameworks primarily use procedural programming methods. In contrast Wicket is strongly based on object oriented patterns. So forget all Struts and JSF patterns, otherwise you won't have fun with Wicket in the long run.
